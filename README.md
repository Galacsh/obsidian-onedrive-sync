# OneDrive Sync

This is a simple plugin to sync your Obsidian vault with [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/)
inspired by [remotely-save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save).
But it differs from remotely-save in that it does not support something smart features.
It just allows you to **pull** from and **push** to OneDrive.

> Since this is for my personal use, I'm not planning to publish it to the community plugins for now.
> However, if you find it useful, give a star to this repo.
> Then I'll consider publishing this plugin with some improvements.
